				<p style="text-align: justify;">The FreshFits app features a user-friendly interface that allows the sorting of clothing by several categories. There are three main categories such as inventory management, outfit matching and social integration.</p>
				<p style="text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #D3D3D3; font-size: 1.5em; margin: 0px">Inventory Management</p>
				<p>
				FreshFits uses new high-end technology such as QR code and scan gun to make an impressive inventory management. We separate the wardrobe category such as: 
				<ul>
				<li>Type: Categorize clothes by type, such as shirts, pants, dresses, and accessories.</li>
				<li>Color: Easily organize clothes by color, simplifying the process of finding matching items.</li>
				<li>Size: Keep track of sizes for quick reference during shopping or outfit planning.</li>
				<li>Quantity: Manage the quantity of each item, aiding in identifying potential gaps in the wardrobe.</li>
				<li>Suggestion: goes beyond wardrobe management and offers personalized outfit suggestions. By analyzing the user's clothing inventory based on type, color, and style, the app provides tailored recommendations for creating stylish outfits from existing items.</li>
				</ul>	 
				</p>
				<p>Fresh Fits provides a user-friendly interface that combines simplicity with an intuitive and visually pleasing clothing browsing experience. The application design is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate through their clothing inventory. The categorization options, including shirts, jeans, shoes, and dresses are prominently displayed for users to quickly sort and filter their wardrobe. In addition, each item is uniquely linked to a Fresh Fits hanger QR code so the article of clothing can be categorized based on type, color, matching potential, size, and quantity. Smaller items such as shoes and accessories can also be paired with QR clips for itemization. Accessory details are displayed on the mobile application and portable tablet/monitor, fostering a seamless interaction between the physical and digital aspects of the wardrobe. This makes the process of curating outfits and swapping fashion items with friends an engaging and visually satisfying experience.</p>

Then, the user can search for “Tips” to get recommendations on what pairs well with the clothing item. All items on the recommendation tab are interactive so the user can select it to see item details and the matching compatibility percentage.</p>
