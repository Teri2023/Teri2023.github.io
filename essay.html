			    <p style="text-align: justify;">For this course, I have learned multiple prototyping such as sketch, storyboard, wireframing, video prototyping, functional prototyping (Figma), interface prototyping (Voiceflow). To support my smart rice cooker design  , I sketched my device including water container, rice containers, control panel, monitor and rice cooker.  It helped me to draft my ideal as my record. I did not choose the storyboard because I combined it with functional prototyping (figma) to explain their step. I did not use wireframe because it includes interface prototyping (voiceflow).&nbsp;</p>
		      <p style="text-align: justify;">For the next step, I started with voiceflow as my interface prototyping to generate my smart cook voice interface. I was impressed when using the voiceflow. The first impression was simple user-friendly design with 6 functions such as event, AI, Talk, listen, logic, dev, and library. Each function included multiple functions to give you more suggestions. The second impression was using workflow to generate the tool . It is the best combined process from design, development, implementation, and demonstration. I really love their ideas and how they organize their applications. According to voicedflow demonstration, my tool will be greeting the user to the Smart Rice and ask the rice’s type the user want to cook with 3 options: white rice, brow rice, and thai jasmine rice. If the user chooses the white rice, it will ask you the water level you want to add with 4 options: 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. If the user chooses 25% and 50% of water, it will return your rice to be ready and ask to continue the cooking or not. If the user chooses yes, it will return to ask the rice type with three options. If the user chooses No, it will end the application.&nbsp;</p>
		      <p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, I also built the functional prototyping in Figma to let my user can use phone to control my device. According to Figma workflow, the user will start with the welcome screen including the logo, greeting statement, and starting button. After clicking starting button, the user can choose the rice type with three options: white rice, brown rice, and Thai jasmine rice. The user can return to the welcome screen by clicking the logo. After choosing the rice, the user will choose the water level. The user can return to the rice type screen by clicking the back button next to the logo. After choosing the water level, the user can see the confirmation “The rice is ready” and the next process. If the user chooses no, the app will say thank you. Figma also has user-friendly design with the tool set on the top navigation such as move, frame, draw tool, pen tool, text tool, component, hand tool, asking tool, username, share, code, demo button, zoom level. The column on the left side was the layer, asset, and page. The column in the center is the workplace. The column on the right side was design and prototype tape. The first impression was layer to support for design easily with copy and paste action. It reduces time consuming for repeating the design. The second impression was the prototype function to generate the link between the screen to the other screen or action. The third impression was the demonstration that generated a phone simulation application.&nbsp;</p>
			    <p style="text-align: justify;">For conclusion, although the class is overwhelming for me, but have learned multiple prototyping and improve my user graphic design ability. Thank you, professor and TA, to support me a lot. </p>
